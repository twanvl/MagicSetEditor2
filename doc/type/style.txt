Data type: style

--Overview--

A style specifies how a [[type:field]] should look,
things like position, size, fonts, colors, etc.

Styles are part of the [[file:style triangle]]:
| Description		Looks			Data
| [[type:Game]]		[[type:Stylesheet]]	[[type:Set]]
| [[type:Field]]	'''Style'''		[[type:Value]]

--Positioning--

<img src="style-positioning.png" alt="" style="float:right;border:1px solid #ccc;"/>
A style specifies the position of a box for the content.
To specify the horizontal location ''two'' of @left@, @width@ and @right@ must be specified.

For example:
> left:  10
> width: 20
Implies that @right@ is 30 pixels.

Similarly:
> left: 10
> right: 30
Implies the @width@ is 20.

The same holds for the vertical location and size; @top@, @height@ and @bottom@.

--Rotation--
Rotating a box can be done with the @angle@ property.
The angle gives a counter clockwise rotation in degrees of the box.
The box is rotated such that the corner for which the position is specified is at the correct position after rotating.

Here are some examples:

	>red box:
	>       width:  30
	>       height: 25
	>       left:   10
	>       top:    20
	>       angle:  30
	
	>green box:
	>       width:  25
	>       height: 30
	>       left:   10
	>       top:    80
	>       angle:  90
	
	 	>blue box:
	 	>       width:  30
	 	>       height: 25
	 	>       right:  90
	 	>       bottom: 30
	 	>       angle:  30
	 	
	 	>yellow box:
	 	>       width:  20
	 	>       height: 35
	 	>       right:  60
	 	>       bottom: 60
	 	>       angle:  180


--Properties--
! Property		Type					Default		Description

The rest of the properties depend on the type of [[type:field]] this style is for.
! Type		Property		Type			Default		Description
| @"text"@	@font@			[[type:font]]		''Required'' 	Font to render the text.
| ^^^		@symbol font@		[[type:symbol font]]	 		Font to render symbols in the text (optional).

| ^^^		@alignment@		[[type:scriptable]] [[type:alignment]]	@top left@	Alignment of the text.
| ^^^		@direction@		[[type:direction]]	@"left to right"@	Direction in which the text flows. If set to @"vertical"@ it is as if a line break is inserted after each character.

| ^^^		@padding bottom min@	^^^			^^^		^^^
| ^^^		@line height soft@	[[type:scriptable]] [[type:double]]		@1@		Multiplier for the line height of 'soft' line breaks. These are breaks caused by wrapping around lines that are too long.<br/>
		 			 			 		A line height of @0@ means all lines are in the same position, @1@ is normal behaviour, @2@ skips a line, etc.
| ^^^		@line height hard@	[[type:scriptable]] [[type:double]]		@1@		Multiplier for the line height of 'hard' line breaks. These are breaks caused by the enter key.
| ^^^		@line height line@	[[type:scriptable]] [[type:double]]		@1@		Multiplier for the line height of 'soft' line breaks. These are breaks caused by @"<line>\n</line>"@ tags.
| ^^^		@line height soft max@	[[type:scriptable]] [[type:double]]		''disabled''	When there is still vertical room in the text box, increase the line heights to at most these values to spread the text more evenly.

| ^^^		@line height line max@	^^^			^^^		^^^
| ^^^		@paragraph height@	[[type:double]]		''flexible''	The height of paragraphs. If specified, each paragraph is given this much space, and aligned inside that space as specified by @alignment@.<br/>

		 			 			 		Text is never put in black areas of the box:<br/>
		 			 			 		<img src="style-text-mask.png" alt=""/><br/>
		 			 			 		The same mask image is also used to determine the size and shape of the box.
		 			 			 		To include a certain pixel in the size/shape but not allow text to be placed there, it can be made dark gray (a value less than 128).
| ^^^		@content width@		[[type:double]]		''automatic''	When read from a script, gives the width of the current content in this box.
